### The Columbia [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/) and [Columbia Enterpreneuship](http://entrepreneurship.columbia.edu/) are organizing the Second Week-long Intensive Data Science Boot Camp

- **When**: January 8th – 12th, 2018
- **Where**: Columbia Entrepreneurship Design Studio, Room 430 of the Riverside Church (490 Riverside Dr, New York, NY 10027)
- **Daily schedule**: 10am to 4pm (*9am to 10am, Introduction Monday, January 8th)
- **Who should apply**: PhD students and postdoctoral scholars who have working knowledge of programming and data analytics and are ready to sharpen their skills to include a training in data science.

The [Collaboratory@Columbia](http://collaboratory.columbia.edu/) is pleased to announce our second annual free  Data Science Bootcamp coming up over the winter break.  This week-long, immersive, hands-on workshop  is especially designed for Columbia University PhD students and postdoctoral scholars who are interested in extending their existing mathematical and programming skills to include a training in data science. Faculty may apply. Designed by faculty and postdoctoral scholars from Columbia University’s [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/), the curriculum includes on-line learning material, introductory lectures, hands-on laboratory experiences and a capstone project.

### About the instructors
![andy](misc-files/andy.jpeg) Andreas Mueller is a lecturer at the [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.columbia.edu/)at Columbia University and author of the O’Reilly book “[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://amueller.github.io/#book)”, describing a practical approach to machine learning with python and scikit-learn. He is one of the core developers of the scikit-learn machine learning library, and he has been co-maintaining it for several years. He is also a [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) instructor. In the past, he worked at the NYU Center for Data Science on open source and open science, and as Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon. You can find his full  cv [here](http://amueller.github.io/cv_andreas_mueller.pdf). His mission is to create open tools to lower the barrier of entry for machine learning applications, promote reproducible science and democratize the access to high-quality machine learning algorithms.
