    "# Probabilistic Matrix Factorization \n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook, we implement probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) on movie rating dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization is a method to decompose a matrix into multiplication of matrices (usually two matrices). A matrix can represent a dyadic data. Matrix factorization is a way to better understand the components (dyads), and use them in further tasks. The goal is to find those unknown matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a probabilistic extension of matrix factorization where unknown parameters are described with their probability distributions. Similar to matrix factorization, the goal of PMF is to learn embeddings from dyadic/relational data (each matrix entry is a dyad, e.g., user-item rating, document-word count, user-user link). If the matrix has missing values, by learning decomposition based on observed entries, missing values can be pre dicted. This technique is useful in variety of applications such as recommender systems/collaborative filtering, link prediction in social network, and so on. In this project, are going to use PMF in collaborating filtering. The goal of collab orative filtering is to infer user preferences for items given a large but incomplete collection of preferences for many users. If we let each row of the original matrix represent a user, and each column represent a product, we can interpret the entries of the matrix to be the rating given to a product by a user.\n",
    "\n",
    "By learning latent features for users and movies using the seen ratings, we are able to predict the ratings for the unseen entries. "
